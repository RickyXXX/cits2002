Your program, named besttq, should accept command-line arguments providing the name of the tracefile and three integers representing times measured in microseconds. The program is only required to produce a single line of output (though you may wish to produce several more lines, as a form of debugging) reporting the best time-quantum found.  For example, the following command might produce the single line of output:  prompt> ./besttq  tracefile1  100  2000  100  best  1600  440800 The command reads and evaluates (simulates, 'executes') the contents of the tracefile several times, employing different time-quanta, to find which time-quantum results in the lowest total process completion time.  The command, above, considers the different time-quantum values of 100 microseconds, 200 microseconds, ... 2000 microseconds (just like a for loop in C99). The program has determined that the best time-quantum for the given job-mix is 1600 microseconds and which results in a total process completion time of 440800  microseconds.  Your program can print out any additional information (debugging?) that you want - just ensure that the last line is of the form "best  1600  440800".
